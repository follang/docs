    description: "FOL is a general-purpose, systems programming language designed for robustness, efficiency, portability, expressiveness and most importantly elegance. Heavily inspired (and shamelessly copying) from languages: rust, go, zig, nim, c++, julia (in this order), hence the name - FOL (Frankenstein’s Original Language). In Albanian language “fol” means “speak” "

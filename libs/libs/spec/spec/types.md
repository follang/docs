Every value in Fol is of a certain data type, which tells Fol what kind of data is being specified so it knows how to work with that data. There are four main subsets: simple, container, complex and special.

# Simple

Simple types are the most primitive type of data:
```
int[options], flt[options], chr[options], bol
```

## Intiger type
An integer is a number without a fractional component. We used one integer of the u32 type, the type declaration indicates that the value itâ€™s associated with should be an unsigned integer (signed integer types start with i, instead of u) that takes up 32 bits of space: 
```
var aVar: int[u32] = 45;
```
Each variant can be either signed or unsigned and has an explicit size. Signed and unsigned refer to whether itâ€™s possible for the number to be negative or positiveâ€”in other words, whether the number needs to have a sign with it (signed) or whether it will only ever be positive and can therefore be represented without a sign (unsigned). Itâ€™s like writing numbers on paper: when the sign matters, a number is shown with a plus sign or a minus sign; however, when itâ€™s safe to assume the number is positive, itâ€™s shown with no sign.
```
Length  |   Signed  | Unsigned  |
-----------------------------------
8-bit   |   8       |   u8      |
16-bit  |   16      |	u16     |
32-bit	|   32      |	u32     |
64-bit	|   64	    |   u64     |
128-bit	|   128     |	u128    |
arch	|   arch    |	uarch   |
```

## Float type
Fol also has two primitive types for floating-point numbers, which are numbers with decimal points. Folâ€™s floating-point types are `flt[32]` and `flt[64]`, which are 32 bits and 64 bits in size, respectively. The default type is `flt[64]` because on modern CPUs itâ€™s roughly the same speed as `flt[32]` but is capable of more precision. 
```
Length  |    Type  |
--------------------
32-bit	|   32     |
64-bit	|   64     |
arch	|   arch   |
```
Floating-point numbers are represented according to the IEEE-754 standard. The `flt[32]` type is a single-precision float, and `flt[f64]` has double precision.

```
pro[] main: int = {
    var aVar: flt = 2.;                         // float 64 bit
    var bVar: flt[64] = .3;                     // float 64 bit
    .assert(.sizeof(aVar) == .sizeof(bVar))     // this will true

    var bVar: flt[32] = .54;                    // float 32 bit
}
```
## Character type
In The Unicode Standard 8.0, Section 4.5 "General Category" defines a set of character categories. Fol treats all characters in any of the letter as Unicode letters, and those in the Number category as Unicode digits. 
```
chr[utf8,utf16,utf32]
```

```
def testChars: tst["some testing on chars"] = {
    var bytes = "hello";
    .assert(.typeof(bytes) == *var [5:0]u8);
    .assert(bytes.len == 5);
    .assert(bytes[1] == 'e');
    .assert(bytes[5] == 0);
    .assert('e' == '\x65');
    .assert('\u{1f4a9}' == 128169);
    .assert('ðŸ’¯' == 128175);
    .assert(.mem.eql(u8, "hello", "h\x65llo"));
}
```
## Boolean type
The boolean type is named `bol` in Fol and can be one of the two pre-defined values `true` and `false`. 
```
bol
```

# Container

Containers re compound types. They contain other primitive types. To access the types in container those brackets are used: `[]`, so:
```
var container: type = { element, element, element }             // declaring a container
var varable: type = container[2]                                // accessing the last element
```
<h6 style="color:red; !important;">Containers are always zero indexed</h6>

## Arrays
```
arr[type,size]
```
Arrays are the most simple type of container. They contain homogeneous type, meaning that each element in the array has the same type. Arrays always have a fixed length specified as a constant expression `arr[type, size]`. They can be indexed by any ordinal type to acces its members.

```
pro[] main: int = {
    var anArray: arr[int, 5] = { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 };             // declare an array of intigers of five elements
    var element = anArray[3];                                 // accessing the element
    .echo(element)                                            // prints: 3
}
```

## Sets
```
set[type,type,type..]
```
A set is a general way of grouping together a number of values with a variety of types into one compound type. Sets have a fixed length: once declared, they cannot grow or shrink in size. In other programming languages they usually are referenced as tuples.
```
pro[] main: int = {
    var aSet: set[str, flt, arr[int, 2]] = { "go", .3, { 0, 5, 3 } };
    var element = aSet[2][1];                                 // accessing the [1] element of the `arr` in the set
    .echo(element)                                            // prints: 5
}
```

## Sequences
```
seq[type]
```

Sequences are similar to arrays but of dynamic length which may change during runtime (like strings). Sequences are implemented as growable arrays, allocating pieces of memory as items are added. A sequence `s` is always indexed by integers from `0` to `.len(s)-1` and its bounds are checked.
```
pro[] main: int = {
    var aSequence: arr[str] = { "get", "over", "it" };        // declare an array of intigers of five elements
    aSequence.add("pal!")
    var element = aSequence[3];                               // accessing the element
    .echo(element)                                            // prints: pal!
}
```
The lower bound of an array or sequence may be received by the built-in `.low()`, the higher bound by `.high()`. The length may be received by `.len()`.
<h6 style="color:red; !important;">Sequences are a growable arrays, thus if not allocated in heap but in stack, the size will be defined automatically in compile time and will be changet to static containers (array)</h6>

To allocate memory on heap, the `var[new]` is used [ more about memory, ownreship and pointer ](/std/spec/050_pointers/):

```
pro[] main: int = {
    var[new] aSequence: arr[str] = { "get", "over", "it" };   // this sequence is stored in stack
}
```
## Maps
```
map[key,value]
```
A map is an unordered group of elements of one type, called the element type, indexed by a set of unique keys of another type, called the key type.
```
pro[] main: int = {
    var aMap: map[str, int] = { { "US", 45 }, { "DE", 82 }, { "AL", 54 } };
    var element = aMap["US"];                                 // accessing the "US" key
    .echo(element)                                            // prints: 45
}
```
The number of map elements is called its length. For a map `aMap`, it can be discovered using the built-in function `.len` and may change during execution To add a new element, we use `add` function:

```
.echo(.len(aMap))           // prints: 3
aMap.add({ "IT", 55 })
.echo(.len(aMap))           // prints: 4
```
The comparison operators `==` and `!=` must be fully defined for operands of the key type; thus the key type must not be a function, map, or sequence.
<h6 style="color:red; !important;">Maps are a growable containers too, thus if not allocated in heap but in stack, the size will be defined automatically in compile time and will be changet to static containers</h6>

## Any
```
any[]
```
## Matrix
Matrixes are of type SIMD (single instruction, multiple data )
```
mat[sizex]
mat[sizex,sizey]
mat[sizex,sizey,sizez]
```

# Complex
there are two complex types:
```
num[arch,64,128]
str[8,16,32]
```
## Numbers
Numbers are complex too and are made of intiger part, sign part, and float part, for example a number -23.44 is made of negative=true, int=24 and flt=0,44. By default has is made by default "architecture size" types, on 64bit:

- `num` is similar to `set[bol,int[arch],flt[arch]]`

## Strings
Strings are a complex type that are made of array of chars with null terminator '\0', and by default is utf8 encoded:

- `str` is similar to `set[seq[char[utf8]],'\0']`

# Special
```
ptr[basetype]
err[basetype]
non
nod
```
